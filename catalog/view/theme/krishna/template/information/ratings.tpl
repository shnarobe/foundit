Reviews & ratings in MultiMerch
MultiMerch has a vendor & product review system that is similar to what Amazon and eBay offer to their customers. It allows customers to review & rate products from their past orders â€“ it is then used by MultiMerch to determine vendor rating and reliability.

The updated MultiMerch review system is available starting with MultiMerch 8.0.

How it works
MultiMerch allows customers to leave feedback on past orders, which consists of a star rating and a description. This feedback is then used by MultiMerch to determine the reliability of the vendor that is visible to other customers. The process is as follows:

The customer purchases one or more products from MultiMerch vendors
After the order is completed, the customer is presented with an option to leave product feedback
Vendor profiles and products have detailed feedback information available that is presented to marketplace visitors
Reviews need to be enabled throuth Admin > MultiMerch > Settings > Products > Reviews.

Leaving a review
After the customer has completed their order, they are presented with a "Leave feedback" button in their account. This redirects the customer to the MultiMerch review form.

MultiMerch also displays a star breakdown for each product. This makes it possible for visitors to see how reliable is the product and what's the proportion of positive and negative reviews from previous customers.

Vendor rating
In addition to product ratings, MultiMerch displays all feedback from vendor's products in a separate tab in vendor profiles. This lets the customer determine whether the vendor is reliable and can be trusted.
