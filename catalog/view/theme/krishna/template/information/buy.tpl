<h2 class="text-center">Still have questions?</h2>
<p>I’m pretty busy. How long will it take to get my stuff up on eBay?
We realize you want to sell your stuff right now. Our quick listing tool makes selling on eBay a snap. Once you’re signed into your eBay account, you’ll find guidance and tips that will help you list your item fast. Don’t have an account yet? It’s easy to set up an eBay account.</p>

<p>Is it really free to list?
Most of the time, yes! All eBay sellers get 50 free listings every month, and it’s just 30 cents a listing if you go beyond that. You only pay seller fees when your stuff sells, which is a small percentage of the final price. Learn more about final value fees.</p>

<p>I want everyone to see my stuff. How do I do that?
Now you sound like a seller! Helping buyers find your stuff begins with a great listing. Take great photos (you can post 12 of them for free), write a descriptive title, and describe your item with as much detail as you can. Do that and you’ll definitely increase your chances.</p>

<p><h2>What happens after my stuff sells? I still have to ship it out, right?</h2>
Naturally! But we help you out there, too. You can print labels with postage right at home for shipping discounts up to 25% off. We even include some tips on how other sellers package and ship similar items. You can also sell your item with local pickup in mind -- just arrange a pickup time and location with your buyer after they’ve paid for the item.</p>

<p>Selling sounds easy, but how do I get paid?
Once your item sells on eBay, all payments are safely and securely handled by PayPal for an additional fee. If you’ve got an account, great! Just link it to your listing and your buyer will send the money to this account. Be patient, because it may take a little time for your buyer to send payment after purchase. If you don't have one yet, it's easy to set up a PayPal account.</p>
